# Policing-Report
This report includes results and documentation after studying open police data. 

We suggest starting with the write up contained in the file named main.tex,
 then proceeding to the .ipynb for additional graphs and information,
 and finally seeing where the income and poverty data come from in the R markdown. 

The Los Angeles police data can be found at https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-2019/yru6-6re4
and the New York Police data can be found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u
